# Habit Tracker â€“ Command-Line Based Habit Logging

This beginner-level Python project helps users track daily habits like reading, programming, or exercise through a command-line interface (CLI). Users can add habits and mark them as "done" each day. The program uses dictionaries, loops, and basic input validation to store and update progress.
